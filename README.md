Implementing evolution strategies for applications in equity trading

The idea of this project is to implement the results of a paper from OpenAI https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/ in the field of Evolution Strategies.

The goal of the paper is to offer an alternative to reinforcement learning as the training of such models is lenghty and computationally expensive with the backward calculation. Through a shock in the parameters, the model will be recomputed using these new parameters and looking at the results, the best shock will be selected and it will repeat this optimization step.
